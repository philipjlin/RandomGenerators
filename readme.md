## Description
A web application with two tools - one for generating lorem ipsum text, and another for generation random user data.

The lorem ipsum generator outputs random lorem ipsum text, with the amount of words or sentences that the user wants as input.

The random user generator creates a fake profile of a random individual, with options to display the name, address, phone number, email, username, and password for the profile. A randomly generated avatar image is also displayed.
